AI
-->agents 
----> data sceince (EDA)
-------> When predicting non-existent problem = Machine Learning
ML 
    1. computer vision 
    2. NLP 
    3. ASP
advanced ML = Deep Learning


STEPS TO ML:
    1. ingredient (Data gathering)
    2. grocery store jainga (Online Article/websites)
    3. Preprocessing (cleaning, filling)
    4. cooking technique (any ML technique)
    5. Tasting (Model Evaluation)
    6. khud khaonga (bhar me jao sab)
    7. Presentation (Zindabad Mubashir Puttar)

TWO TYPES OF MACHINE Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised: when the value you want to train for is in the dataset (Target Column)

    YES/NO = CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

    NUMBERS = REGRESSION PROBLEM
